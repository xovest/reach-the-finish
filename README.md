# reach-the-finish
It's a basic 2D game I made when I was learning about C++ and matrix positions.

You can play this game in your cmd or terminal, all you gotta do is compile it and then run the exe file.

You're playing as Arnold (that's the name of the player I came up with) and you've got to reach the finish. You can also add doors, keys and walls to make it more interesting if you're willing to. All the instructions and objects will appear as soon as you run the program and then you can create your own level and beat it afterwards. Why not give it a go?
