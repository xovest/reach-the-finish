# reach-the-finish
It's a basic 2D game I made when I was learning about C++ and matrix positions.

You can play this game in your cmd, all you gotta do is compile it and then run the exe file.

You're basically A (Arnold, that's the name of your player) and you've got to reach the finish. You got all the instructions and object when running the program and you can create your own level and then beat it. Why not give it a go?
