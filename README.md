# reach-the-finish
It's a basic 2D game I made when I was learning about C++ and matrix positions.

You can play this game in your cmd or terminal, all you gotta do is compile it and then run the exe file (you can type in your cmd or terminal or whatever: g++ rtf.cpp -o rtf).

You're playing as Arnold (that's the name of your player I came up with, lol) and you've got to reach the finish. You can also add doors and walls and everything to make it more interesting if you're willing to. All the instructions and objects will appear when you run the program you can create your own level and then beat it. Why not give it a go?
